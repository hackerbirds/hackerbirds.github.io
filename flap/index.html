            <p>Our expert team of crows has been trained to provide the best file transfer service.
                Give them your packages and watch them magically flap from one device to another,
                with the utmost care for your privacy and security.

            <h3>END-TO-END ENCRYPTION, EVERYTIME</h3>
            <p>Our team would not learn anything should they decide to tear open your packages in transit--
                you can rest assured that no one but the recipient knows what's in your package, thanks to
                <b class="text-highlight">state-of-the-art crowptography</b>.
            </p>
            <h3>DIRECT CAWMMUNICATION</h3>
            <p>Your packages are directly transmitted to the device you intend to. <b class="text-highlight">There are
                    no middlebirds during the transit.</b>
            </p>
            <p>To ensure reliability, crows may still communicate with the rest of the flock to
                determine the recipient's final location. This does not affect your privacy,
                and will become optional in the future.</p>
            <h3>CROWCURRENT</h3>
            <p>You may transfer <b class="text-highlight">more than one file at a time</b>. Just throw them to the
                crows,
                and they'll take care of the rest.
